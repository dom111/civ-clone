# civ-clone

Open source, plugin-based, clone of the original Civilization, written in JavaScript and utilising electron for cross platform implementation.

---

## Done

Currently just the beginnings of the game engine, including:

  - Plugin system to allow easy extension
  - Unit movement and basic combat resolution
  - City building
  - Basic world generator
  - Framework for research, currency, units

_Currently requires original assets to be extracted from the original Civilization files which is a little laborious at present._

## TODO:

  - City screen
  - Tax/science/luxury rate management
  - Store map for each user so changes behind 'fog of war' cannot be observed
  - Leader interactions
  - Improve world building - perhaps investigate existing mechanisms?
  - So much more...
