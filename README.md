# civ-clone

Open source, plugin-based, clone of the original Civilization

---

Currently just the beginnings of the game engine, including:

  - Plugin system to allow easy extension
  - Unit movement and basic combat resolution
  - City building and unit production

_Currently requires original assets to be extracted from the original Civilization files._

## TODO:

  - So much...
