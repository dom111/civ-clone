# TODO

- [x] Remove electron requirement.
- [x] Add ESlint
- [x] Separate renderer logic from data and models.
- [x] Switch plugins to being ES modules.
- [x] Re-do plugin system to remove 'priority' and rely on dependencies directly.
- [x] Get AI players to move units.
- [x] Convert all raw data files to JS classes.
- [x] Re-do world generation.
- [X] Remove reliance on augmenting Engine directly.
- [X] Work on city build list.
- [X] Combat.
- [X] When building World, ensure there are enough starting squares.
- [X] Add user-definable rulesets.
- [X] Non-human players.
- [X] Write tests.
- [X] Fix map tiling.
- [X] City Improvements/Wonders.
- [X] Control city improvement costs via `Rule`s.
- [X] Control unit base stats via `Rule`s.
- [X] Fix AI bug with NavalTransports.
- [X] More civilizations.
- [X] Reorganise all existing plugins to extract self-contained entities (perhaps so they they are testable?)
- [X] Fix AI bug where they always trend north-east. Maybe this is just masked - but seems less problematic.
- [X] Add science.
- [X] Add 'trade' tile yield.
- [ ] Abstract World class to allow implementation of hexes rather than squares and other world generators.
- [ ] Ensure Engine is passed to plugins in read-only mode, but expose events system.
- [ ] Break all plugins into `core` (parent classes/interfaces/rules) and `base` (implementations).
- [ ] Convert to TypeScript?
- [ ] Re-work the 'trade' mechanism to not be hard-coded.
- [ ] Renderer interface.
- [ ] Input management (keyboard/mouse) - tied to renderer?
- [ ] i18n/l10n.
- [ ] City Happiness.
- [ ] Remote network players.
- [ ] Even more civilizations.
- [ ] Governments.
- [ ] Difficulties.
- [ ] Add optional dependencies to plugins.
- [ ] Add `PlayerMap` classes that only see what the Player has discovered.
- [ ] Human players - this is likely dependent on a renderer, although perhaps make it playable within a TTY?
- [ ] Write more tests.
- [ ] Feature parity with Civilization.
- [ ] Add pathing mechanisms (A*?)
- [ ] Add more units.
- [ ] Add more city improvements.
- [ ] Add wonders.
- [ ] Add wealth.
- [ ] Add build-queue.
- [ ] Add Barbarians.
- [ ] Change terrain specials to be augments instead of specific terrain types - this would allow rivers as they are in Civ 2+
